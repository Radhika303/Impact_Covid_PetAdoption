# Impact_Covid_PetAdoption

A team project with Mabel Alamu, Jen Johansson, JB Kinlacheeny, Radhika Sagar to analyze the impact of COVID-19 had on pet adoption rates in Norfolk, VA and Dallas, TX.

We take a look at available COVID data (documented, positive test results) and cross-reference it with publicly available data related to pet adoptions to determine if there is an increase in pet adoptions as the pandemic continues.


Null Hypothesis:

        *There is no correlation between COVID positive cases and pet adoption rates.

Alternative Hypothesis:

       *There is a correlation between adoption rates in 2020 (after March) due to more individuals staying at home (as indicated by COVID cases).
       
       
Research Questions: 

    *What is the baseline adoption rate by month/year? 
    *Is there an increase in adoption rates after the pandemic hit the US (ie after March 2020)? 
    *If there is a correlation to adoptions, does it correlate to documented COVID cases?
    *Extend the analysis to multiple cities. Do correlations to COVID differ between cities?
