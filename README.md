# Impact_Covid_PetAdoption

A team project with Mabel Alamu, Jen Johansson, JB Kinlacheeny, Radhika Sagar to analyze the impact of COVID-19 had on pet adoption rates in Norfolk, VA and Dallas, TX.

We take a look at available COVID data (documented, positive test results) and cross-reference it with publicly available data related to pet adoptions to determine if there is an increase in pet adoptions as the pandemic continues.


Null Hypothesis:

     *There is no correlation between COVID positive cases and pet adoption rates.

Alternative Hypothesis:

     *There is a correlation between adoption rates in 2020 (after March) due to more individuals staying at home (as indicated by COVID cases).
       
       
Research Questions: 

    *What is the baseline adoption rate by month/year? 
    *Is there an increase in adoption rates after the pandemic hit the US (ie after March 2020)? 
    *If there is a correlation to adoptions, does it correlate to documented COVID cases?
    *Extend the analysis to multiple cities. Do correlations to COVID differ between cities?
    
Summary and Conclusions:

Adoption rates appear to increase over the summer months in Norfolk.  There was a big dip in adoptions in April/May/June 2020, right after the pandemic started.

For Norfolk, we did not find a correlation between COVID cases and pet adoptions. 
The Pearson correlation coefficient was .05 (very weak)
For Dallas, we did find a moderate correlation but it was negative.
The Pearson correlation coefficient was -.5
Inferences/Conclusions:
The adoption dataset for both cities is small, which impacts the analysis and test results.
Other factors could be influencing the results.  For example, were the shelters closed during any time period?  Were people adopting pets through other sources like rescue organizations?
